# Smart-Food-Delivery-Time-Estimator

##  Introduction  

Running a food delivery service comes with the challenge of keeping customers happy by ensuring their meals arrive on time and in good condition. However, factors like traffic congestion and bad weather can cause unpredictable delays, affecting the delivery schedule.  

To address this challenge, we have developed a **Food Delivery Time Prediction System** that utilizes **machine learning**. Our goal is to predict delivery times with high accuracy by analyzing past delivery data, current traffic conditions, and real-time weather updates.  

Additionally, we have built a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** that allows users to input key delivery parameters and receive estimated delivery times. The system categorizes delivery time predictions into the following ranges:  

-  Very Quick: ≤ 15 minutes  
-  Quick: 15–30 minutes  
-  Moderate: 30–45 minutes  
-  Slow: 45–60 minutes  
-  Very Slow: ≥ 60 minutes  

This tool helps food delivery services optimize logistics, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency.

##  Setting Up Datasets  

The datasets used in this project are available on **Kaggle**.  
Place the dataset files in the **datasets/** directory before running the model.  

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing  

The preprocessing steps include:  
1. Standardizing columns into appropriate formats: **strings, integers, and floats**.  
2. Converting **order date** to `datetime` format.  
3. Extracting time from **Time Ordered** and **Time Order Picked**.  
4. Dropping rows with **null values**.  
5. Encoding categorical variables using **label encoding**.  

##  Feature Selection  

Feature selection was performed using **SelectKBest**, which retains only the most significant predictors.  
The implementation is available in `kbest.py`.  

##  Model Improvement  

The following techniques were applied to enhance model performance:  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model parameters using **GridSearchCV**.  

##  Command Line Interface (CLI)  

To use the CLI for predictions:  

1. Navigate to the project directory.  
2. Run the CLI script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py

Follow the promptsto input the delivery parametersna dobtain predictions.
