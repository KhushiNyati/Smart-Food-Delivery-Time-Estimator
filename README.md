Smart-Food-Delivery-Time-Estimator
Introduction 

Running a food delivery service comes with the challenge of keeping customers happy by delivering their meals on time and in good condition despite hurdles like traffic or bad weather, which can throw off the schedule unpredictably.

To address this issue effectively, we have developed a Food Delivery Time Prediction System that utilizes machine learning methods. Our goal is to predict delivery times with precision by analyzing delivery data, current traffic situations, and real-time weather trends.

We have also developed a Command Line Interface (CLI) to allow users to input food delivery parameters and get delivery time predictions. This tool provides an estimate of the food delivery time within specific ranges:

Very Quick: ≤ 15 minutes
Quick: 15–30 minutes
Moderate: 30–45 minutes
Slow: 45–60 minutes
Very Slow: ≥ 60 minutes
